# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

GIF Search App
Hello,

This is a small app that searches for GIFs using the GiphyDev API.

The app has an input field where you can enter a new category (GIFs to search for). When you press enter, it triggers an event that consumes the API and fetches the first ten results found, without deleting previous searches.
